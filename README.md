# MNIST-FASHION
MNIST FASHION  USING TENSOR FLOW
This is a project based on the mnist fashion data set , implementing a convulitional neural network

Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend. The project focuses on training a CNN to recognize and classify images in a supervised learning scenario.

Project Overview:
Dataset:
The model is trained and validated on a dataset of images, represented by x_train and x_validate. The corresponding labels are provided by y_train and y_validate. Ensure that your dataset is appropriately preprocessed and organized.

Model Architecture:
The CNN model architecture is not provided in the snippet, but it is assumed to be defined earlier in the code. CNNs are powerful for image-related tasks as they can automatically learn hierarchical features from the data. Common layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Training:
The training process is executed using the fit function, where the model is trained on the training dataset (x_train, y_train) with specified hyperparameters such as batch size (4096) and number of epochs (75). The training progress is displayed for each epoch.

Validation:
The validation dataset (x_validate, y_validate) is used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch. This helps in monitoring for overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Usage:
Data Preparation:
Make sure to preprocess and organize your image dataset. Ensure that the images are labeled correctly, and the data is split into training and validation sets.

Model Definition:
Define the CNN model architecture before running the training code. Experiment with different architectures, layers, and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

Training:
Execute the training code, adjusting the batch size and number of epochs based on your dataset and computational resources. Monitor the training and validation accuracy and loss to assess model performance.

Evaluation:
After training, evaluate the model on a separate test set or real-world data to assess its generalization capabilities.
